## Binary Class Classification & Multi Class Classification  

* Binary Class Classification  
  
  1. In this project directory, there are 3 folders and 1 file with suffix "**Image_Classifier**" for **binary class classification**. 
  2. You will find "Image_Classifier_data" folder which contains dataset for training binary classification model.
  3. You will find "Image_Classifier_logs" folder which contains logs of training binary classification model.
  4. You will find "Image_Classifier_Model" folder which contains file with keras extension which is trained on given dataset.
  5. Last one is Jupyter Notebook named "Image_Classifier_From_Scratch.ipynb" which contains all code step by step.   
   Note :- Easily anyone can train binary classification model by replacing folders present in Image_Classifier_data and just execute cells in "Image_Classifier_From_Scratch.ipynb" file one by one for better understanding of how code works.

* Multi Class Classification  
  
  1. In this project directory, there are 3 folders and 1 file with suffix "**Multiclass_Classification**" for **multi class classification**. 
  2. You will find "Multiclass_Classification_data" folder which contains dataset for training Multi class classification model.
  3. You will find "Multiclass_Classification_logs" folder which contains logs of training multi class classification model.
  4. You will find "Multiclass_Classification_Model" folder which contains file with keras extension which is trained on given dataset.
  5. Last one is Jupyter Notebook named "Multiclass_Classification_From_Scratch.ipynb" which contains all code step by step.   
   Note :- Easily anyone can train multi classification model by replacing folders present in Multiclass_Classification_data and just execute cells in "Multiclass_Classification_From_Scratch.ipynb" file one by one for better understanding of how code works.
